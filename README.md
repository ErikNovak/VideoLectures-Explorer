# Videolectures Explorer

[Videolectures Explorer](http://explore.videolectures.net/) is a dashboard developed to find similarities between lectures that are published on [Videolectures.NET](http://videolectures.net/). It can also be used for finding appropriate lectures for learning purposes.

### Installing the server

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. In the command prompt run the following commands:
  1. Run ``` npm install ```. It'll install node packages that are used in the project.
  2. Run ``` npm install -g bower ```.  It'll install bower globally. We'll use it later.
  3. Run ``` bower install ```. It'll install the dependancies for the website. They are saved in the public/components folder.
